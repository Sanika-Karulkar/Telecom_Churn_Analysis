# Telecom_Churn_Analysis
This project creates a Customer Churn Prediction System that utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to forecast customer attrition. 

It begins with extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and insights

Followed by thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical features. 

The refined dataset is used to train the model, which is then serialized and deployed in a Flask web application. 

This interface allows users to input customer data and receive real-time churn predictions along with confidence scores, facilitating targeted retention efforts and enhancing overall customer management strategies.
